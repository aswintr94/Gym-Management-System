# gym-management-system

This is a simple gym management website. This is my first project in django and its a trial for me in django and git also.

There will be so many adjustments in the html and css parts in the project. Because it is done to test myself in the backend and version control.

I got this project idea from a youtube video but I didn't copy anything from that except the looks of the website. Also I am thanking him for this wonderful frontend 
created by him.
